Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop.

Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people.

NGS Product Integration Scientist,£34K-£56K (Glassdoor Est.),"Base Genomics is a new start-up that aims to have a major impact on personalised medicine. We are developing TAPS, a breakthrough technology from the University of Oxford that makes epigenetic analysis of DNA methylation more sensitive, accurate and cheaper than ever before. We aim to transform healthcare by enabling early and precise detection of cancer. Long-term, we expect TAPS to become central to a host of major new healthcare and research applications.

Base Genomics has recently raised substantial seed funding and is now looking for talented and highly motivated scientists to participate in this exciting opportunity by joining its nascent R&D team. This is a rare opportunity to develop disruptive technology in one of the most exciting areas of life science and to make a substantial impact on healthcare.

We are looking for a scientist with significant growth potential to help establish our Next Generation Sequencing capabilities and execute Sequencing projects that support our Product Development activities. The successful candidate will be a pro-active team player with excellent communication skills and a desire to work collaboratively at pace towards exciting goals.
Role*
Working with a highly skilled interdisciplinary team at the interface of chemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics you will generate and enable the analysis of DNA sequence and methylation data that enables the development of our applications kits and clinical workflows. It is expected that you will be hands-on in the lab.

You will collaborate highly effectively with the broader R&D team on project requirements, planning, execution and reporting.
Skills and Experience*
Essential
Specialist knowledge of next generation sequencing, including a variety of NGS applications, and a working knowledge of bioinformatics.
Up to date knowledge of molecular diagnostic tests for rare diseases and oncology.
Proven track record of executing a variety of NGS projects in support of product development activities in a commercial environment.
Track record of successful RUO or IVD product development in the life science sector.
Skilled in the interpretation of NGS data and troubleshooting of molecular biology, sequencing and data analysis issues.
Experience of specialised and commonly used molecular biology methods.
Strong team-working skills with previous experience of completing collaborative projects on time and within budget.
Excellent communication skills (both written and oral) with the ability to communicate complex ideas and information to a range of stakeholders.
Demonstrable high levels of self-motivation, ambition, transparency and integrity.
